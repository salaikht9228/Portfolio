## Random Forest Classification of TikTok Videos

* Business Understanding: Millions of videos are posted on TikTok daily, with approximately a million videos being removed daily for violating community guidelines. Due to the high volume of reported videos, it's impractical for human moderators to review them all. Developing a machine learning model to predict whether a video contains a claim or opinion could help direct these videos to human moderators for further review.

* Data Analysis: Using random forest modeling, features associated with user engagement levels with each video, namely the video's view, like, share, and download counts, were identified as most influential in determining whether a video had a claim or an opinion. Furthermore, the model performed with 99.87% accuracy and 99.74% recall.

* Business Understanding: Hiring and training new employees is costly and time-consuming, making employee retention crucial for mitigating these expenses. A machine learning model predicting employee attrition could help identify at-risk employees and implement targeted retention strategies.

* Data Analysis: Using decision tree classification, the model identified that the number of assigned projects, last evaluation scores, tenure of work, and whether an employee was overworked (>170 hours per month) were most influential in determining whether an employee left or stayed with the company. Furthermore, the model performed with 94% accuracy and 91% recall.
